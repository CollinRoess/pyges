PyGES is an IGES file parser, for snagging parametric data out of a file.

Since IGES files are just ASCII text, pyges works its way through the file for parametric data (in the most inefficient way possible for the time being) and will (soon) convert that into XYZ point data, potentially to export as a .asc point cloud.
